# Road-Mapping-GIS
This repository contains a semester long project recreating a mapping software similar to Google Maps. Code is held in a private repository to prevent academic misconduct, so please message me if viewing access is desired.


Written in C++ with two other group members, this project stressed and improved my skills in design, software development, oral and written communication, project management and teamwork.
