# Road-Mapping-GIS
This repository contains a semester long project recreating a mapping software similar to Google Maps. Code is held in a private repository to prevent academic misconduct, so please message me if viewing access is desired.


Written in C++ with two other group members, this project stressed and improved my skills in design, software development, oral and written communication, project management and teamwork. The project is a fully featured road mapping software, with a graphical user interface, walking and driving instructions, subway lines and stations, and live road closures. Our group adopted an agile workflow method, meeting every week to re-evaluate our current workflow plans and shift around work distribution to ensure a high level of performance.  

In terms of navigation, our map uses an A* algorithm to compute the shortest path in an efficient manner, ensuring that users of the map always receive an optimal path.

The final portion of this assignment was to tackle a variaton of the travelling salesman problem. Our task was to optimize a courier's delivery routes across numerous pickups and dropoffs in a city, while also managing a weight limit on the truck. To tackle this problem, our group implemented a 2-opt algorithm utilising multistart to obtain reasonably efficient courier routes.
